The array contains an array like this:
[[Name, GoalieCount, DefenderCount, MidfielderCount, ForwardCount, TotalQuarters],[Name, GoalieCount, DefenderCount, MidfielderCount, ForwardCount, TotalQuarters],[Name, GoalieCount, DefenderCount, MidfielderCount, ForwardCount, TotalQuarters],[Name, GoalieCount, DefenderCount, MidfielderCount, ForwardCount, TotalQuarters],[Name, GoalieCount, DefenderCount, MidfielderCount, ForwardCount, TotalQuarters]]
You can use any number of players and it will calculate so each player plays each position throughout the season.
At the end of the output there is an Updated Players in the same input array format that allows you to update to the actual playtimes for the next game.
